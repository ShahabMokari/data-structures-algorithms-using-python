Codes for Data Structures and Algorithms Using Python, Rance D. Necaise (Wiley, 2010-12-21) 

A key objective of ata Structures and Algorithms Using Python (Rance) is to provide a back to basics approach 
to learning data structures and algorithms without overwhelming the reader with all of the OOP terminology and 
concepts. To provide flexibility in topic coverage for a wide variety of courses, the author focuses on data 
structures and algorithms, while designing the examples to allow the introduction of object-oriented programming 
if so desired. The book also introduces the concept of algorithm analysis and explores the efficiency of algorithms 
and data structures throughout the text.
